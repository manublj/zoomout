- StructuresPage page specs
    
    ### **1. Primary Role**
    
    The **StructuresPage** is the foundational lens through which users can understand the **deep material conditions** of a society. It doesn’t display abstract categories — it **shows how economic, political, social, and cultural structures shape contradictions** and condition the very struggles that unfold over time.
    
    Zoomout treats structures not as static institutions, but as **historically reproduced formations**—accumulated over centuries, transforming through resistance and reform. This page invites users to **trace how these formations reproduce power** and **where they rupture**.
    
    The StructuresPage is not meant for surface-level orientation. It’s built for **strategic analysis**: Where do you intervene? What contradictions are structurally embedded? Which struggles are *truly* structural?
    
    ### **2. Sheets Used**
    
    The StructuresPage draws from multiple sheets to **trace the embeddedness of structures across time, contradiction, and struggle**:
    
    - **Structures Sheet**:
        
        The primary source of structure entries. Each row includes:
        
        - `structure_id`
        - `type` (economic, political, social, cultural)
        - `title`, `abstract`, `description`, `origin`, `region`, `lifespan`, `current_form`
        - Linked contradiction IDs, struggle IDs, and events expressing continuity or rupture.
    - **Contradictions Sheet**:
        
        Shows which contradictions emerge from a structure or are reproduced by it. Used to highlight the structural *roots* of each contradiction.
        
    - **Struggles Sheet**:
        
        Reflects movements that **contest or seek to transform** a given structure. Allows the system to track whether a structure is being stabilized, transformed, or dismantled.
        
    - **Events Sheet**:
        
        Event entries may reference structures directly (e.g., land reform, constitutional amendments, institutional reshuffling) and help **build a timeline of structural evolution**.
        
    
    This multi-sheet linkage ensures that structures are not isolated definitions, but **lived, reproduced, and resisted formations**.
    
    ### **3. Data Relationships**
    
    The StructuresPage sits at the **base layer** of Zoomout’s ontology. It maps how **material formations generate contradictions, are contested by struggles, and evolve through events.**
    
    Each **structure** entry is dynamically linked across the system:
    
    ### **a. Structures → Contradictions**
    
    - Every contradiction must be rooted in one or more material structures.
    - Structures shape the form a contradiction takes (e.g., caste contradiction arises from a **social structure**, but persists through **political** and **economic** reinforcements).
    - The contradiction’s metadata (`structure_id`) pulls from here.
    
    ### **b. Structures → Struggles**
    
    - Struggles emerge when structures are challenged.
    - Each struggle entry carries the `structure_id` it is contesting.
    - Zoomout tracks whether a structure is **being reproduced, ruptured, reformed, or replaced**.
    
    ### **c. Structures → Events**
    
    - Structural continuity or rupture is recorded through event sequences.
    - Events linked to a structure act as **historical proof of transformation or reproduction** (e.g., liberalization reforms, education policy shifts, state violence against institutions).
    
    ### **d. Structures → Entities (Indirect)**
    
    - While structures do not directly reference entities, entity actions in events reveal their **role in reproducing or contesting** a structure.
    - Future: This linkage can generate **alignment heatmaps** between entities and structures.
    
    This relationship web makes it possible to move across **ontological layers**: from structures → contradictions → struggles → events → stances.
    
    ### **4. Layout**
    
    The **StructuresPage layout** is designed to reflect the **categorical clarity and historical weight** of material formations. It emphasizes **typological separation** while enabling **cross-structure exploration**.
    
    ### **Header Section**
    
    - Brief overview of what structures are and how Zoomout treats them
    - Filter bar (dropdowns and chips):
        - Type (economic / political / social / cultural)
        - Region / Country
        - Lifespan (historical / still active)
        - Transformation status (reproduced / ruptured / reformed)
    
    ---
    
    ### **Main Body: Four-Column Grid Layout**
    
    Each column represents a **structure type**:
    
    | Column | Type |
    | --- | --- |
    | 1 | Economic |
    | 2 | Political |
    | 3 | Social |
    | 4 | Cultural |
    - **StructureCard** modules fill each column — vertically scrollable within type.
    - Each card shows:
        - Title
        - Type icon
        - Lifespan bar or tag
        - Number of linked contradictions
        - Number of active struggles
        - Last event timestamp
    
    ---
    
    ### **Right Panel (Optional on Desktop, Overlay on Mobile)**
    
    Appears when a structure is selected. Displays:
    
    - Full `StructureDetailModal`
    - Contradiction map (linked contradictions + their status)
    - Struggles list (categorized by role: contesting, co-opting, reproducing)
    - Event thread (compressed timeline view)
    
    This layout design lets users **see the typological landscape** of structures while also diving into **historical motion and contradiction emergence**.
    
    ### **5. Component Breakdown**
    
    The StructuresPage is built from modular components that allow users to **explore structures both typologically and historically**. Each component reflects a distinct lens: form, contradiction, struggle, reproduction, rupture.
    
    ---
    
    ### **1. `StructureCard`**
    
    - Displays key info:
        - `title`, `type`, `lifespan`, `region`
        - Linked contradictions count (with status chip)
        - Linked struggles count (with status chip)
        - Last updated event date
    - Card background or icon color coded by structure type
    - Clicking opens the `StructureDetailModal`
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. `ContradictionListMini`**
    
    - Appears inside modal
    - List of contradictions where this structure is **originary or reproducing terrain**
    - Each contradiction tag shows current **phase** (latent → explosive)
    - Clicking a tag opens the contradiction page or sidebar preview
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. `StruggleListMini`**
    
    - Highlights key struggles contesting this structure
    - Each entry includes:
        - `struggle_name`
        - Role (e.g., `contesting`, `co-opted`, `suppressed`)
        - Status chip (e.g., `active`, `historic`, `paused`)
    - Clicking opens the struggle detail page/modal
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. `StructureDetailModal`**
    
    - Expands when a structure is selected
    - Tabs or sections:
        - **Overview** (description, historical origin, evolution)
        - **Linked Contradictions**
        - **Active & Historic Struggles**
        - **Timeline of Key Events** (pulled from `Events Sheet`)
    - Considered the **main analytical lens** into a structure
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. `StructureTimelineMini` (Optional)**
    
    - A visual mini-timeline at bottom of `StructureDetailModal`
    - Event dots show transformation points, moments of crisis, reforms
    - Hover to view event titles
    - Color-coded based on transformation type (reform / rupture / reinforcement)
    
    These components together enable users to move from **abstraction (structure)** to **motion (event/struggle/contradiction)** seamlessly.
    
    ### **6. Component Behavior (Expanded)**
    
    Each component on the StructuresPage is designed to behave in ways that reflect the **non-static, historically embedded nature** of structures. The goal is to emphasize motion, linkage, and contradiction without overwhelming the user with complexity.
    
    ### **1. `StructureCard` Behavior**
    
    - **Hover** reveals tooltip: contradiction count + dominant linked struggle
    - **Click** opens `StructureDetailModal`
    - Cards highlight on filter match (e.g., if contradiction or struggle filter applied)
    - Cards animate if new contradiction gets linked (optional future behavior)
    
    ---
    
    ### **2. `StructureDetailModal` Behavior**
    
    - Loads asynchronously to avoid blocking UI
    - Tabs animate on switch (Overview / Contradictions / Struggles / Timeline)
    - Contradictions and struggles update in real time as new entries are logged
    - Clicking any contradiction or struggle tag opens the respective modal/page in split-view or tab
    
    ---
    
    ### **3. `ContradictionListMini` Behavior**
    
    - Tags are color-coded by **intensity phase**
    - Hovering shows quick summary (e.g., “Explosive since Jan 2024”)
    - Tags are clickable — open the full contradiction timeline in overlay
    - Faint glow if contradiction is **Principal** in current period (future feature)
    
    ---
    
    ### **4. `StruggleListMini` Behavior**
    
    - Each struggle tag fades in/out based on activity status
    - Role chips (support, resist, co-opt) dynamically reorder based on filter
    - “Contesting Structure” struggles rise to top when modal opens
    
    ---
    
    ### **5. `StructureTimelineMini` Behavior (Optional)**
    
    - Dots animate in when timeline loads
    - Hover on dot shows event title and date
    - Click navigates to event page with context of structure highlighted
    - Dots expand or change color based on event impact (e.g., major reform = large dot)
    
    The behavior layer ensures **structures are not treated as reference material**, but as **dynamic, living terrains of historical struggle and contradiction.**
    
    ### **7. Interaction Flows**
    
    The StructuresPage is built to support both **guided exploration** and **targeted investigation**. Users can drop in with a specific structure in mind or follow a contradiction back to its structural roots.
    
    ### **A. Flow: Contradiction → Structure**
    
    1. User visits a contradiction page (e.g., *Caste vs. Capital*)
    2. Sees that contradiction is rooted in multiple structures (e.g., **Brahminical Social Hierarchy**, **Land Ownership System**)
    3. Clicks structure tag → Opens `StructureDetailModal` from within contradiction view
    4. Sees all contradictions, struggles, and events linked to that structure
    5. Returns with a broader understanding of **structural reproduction**
    
    ### **B. Flow: Structure → Contradiction → Event**
    
    1. User lands on StructuresPage → Filters by `type: economic`
    2. Clicks **Wage Labor Regime (Post-1991)**
    3. In modal, sees contradictions like *Capital vs. Informal Labor*
    4. Clicks contradiction → Views escalation timeline → Jumps to recent protest event
    5. Ends with precise understanding of how structures give rise to contradiction, which then erupt in events
    
    ### **C. Flow: Structure → Struggle**
    
    1. User explores **Patriarchal Kinship System** under `social structures`
    2. Sees struggle tag: *Feminist Movements (Tamil Nadu)*
    3. Opens struggle → Sees event timeline + contradiction + state repression timeline
    4. User now grasps how structure is being contested in multiple arenas
    
    ### **D. Flow: Filtered Macro View**
    
    1. User filters: `type: cultural`, `region: South India`, `status: active`
    2. Sees five ongoing structures reproduced through media, education, religion
    3. Compares contradiction density across structures
    4. Pinpoints which structure needs closer historical tracing
    
    These flows ensure that the StructuresPage isn’t static — it becomes a **gateway to all other ontological elements**: contradiction, struggle, entity, and event.
    
    ### **8. Key UI Behavior**
    
    The StructuresPage must **visually encode stability vs. rupture, reproduction vs. transformation**. These behaviors help users intuitively grasp which structures are contested, which are inert, and which are in motion.
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Color-Coding by Structure Type**
    
    - **Economic:** Steel Blue
    - **Political:** Crimson Red
    - **Social:** Deep Teal
    - **Cultural:** Burnt Orange
        
        Used across card headers, filter chips, and timeline dots.
        
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Lifespan Display**
    
    - Lifespan displayed as a horizontal bar under each card title
        - **Solid line:** Continuous reproduction
        - **Dashed segments:** Interrupted / restructured moments
        - **Ends with glow:** Recently transformed or ruptured
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Contradiction and Struggle Chips**
    
    - Contradiction tags flash if their phase recently escalated
    - Struggle tags show pulsing glow if marked “Active”
    - Hovering shows contextual tooltip: “Escalated Jan 2023,” “Co-opted by Congress (2021)”
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Scroll-Triggered Transitions**
    
    - As user scrolls vertically through structure cards, top header bar collapses into sticky filter toolbar
    - Right-panel modal floats in or expands on selection
    - TimelineMini animates in from the bottom of modal after data is fetched
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. Subtle Emphasis on Reproduction**
    
    - Structures with **no struggles or contradictions** fade slightly to emphasize “undisturbed reproduction”
    - A faint “reproduction intensity bar” could appear below each card over time (future feature)
    
    ---
    
    These behaviors **embed theoretical meaning directly into UI mechanics** — the user is not just scrolling data, they’re reading **the motion of historical structures.**
    
    ### **9. Visual Design Guidelines**
    
    The StructuresPage should feel like a **landscape of deep formations** — grounded, historical, but alive with potential rupture. The design must reflect **categorical stability** while surfacing **points of contradiction and struggle**.
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Structural Color Codes (Consistent Across App)**
    
    - **Economic** — `#4682B4` (Steel Blue)
    - **Political** — `#B22222` (Firebrick Red)
    - **Social** — `#008080` (Deep Teal)
    - **Cultural** — `#CC5500` (Burnt Orange)
    
    Used in:
    
    - Card headers and accent lines
    - Filter chips
    - Badges for type indicators
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Typography**
    
    - **Titles:** `font-bold text-lg`
    - **Abstracts:** `text-base text-gray-700`
    - **Timelines and Metadata:** `text-sm text-muted-foreground`
    - Use **monospace** for structure IDs and schema-referenced fields in detail modal
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Icons (Consistent Symbolism)**
    
    - Economic = Factory
    - Political = Gavel or Parliament Dome
    - Social = People Chain
    - Cultural = Theater Masks or Book
        
        Icons placed in top-left of `StructureCard` and next to section headers in the detail modal.
        
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Motion Cues**
    
    - Use **pulse animation** on contradiction or struggle badges marked “active”
    - **Transition glow** on cards when new links (contradictions/struggles) are formed
    - Fade-in for historical structures marked “currently dormant”
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. Layout Principles**
    
    - Four-column desktop layout with uniform width cards
    - Modal drawer or floating overlay for expanded structure view
    - TimelineMini uses colored dots and bars aligned horizontally, with labels below on hover
    
    ---
    
    The visual experience must embody the **weight of structure** and the **friction of resistance** — a UI that both grounds and activates the user.
    
    ### **10. Empty States**
    
    Empty states on the StructuresPage aren’t just UX necessities — they carry **epistemological weight.** An empty field is not neutral; it signals reproduction without resistance, contradiction yet to be articulated, or historical erasure.
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. No Contradictions Linked**
    
    **Message:**
    
    > “This structure has no contradictions recorded yet.
    > 
    > 
    > Is it uncontested — or has its contradictions not yet been surfaced?”
    > 
    
    **CTA:**
    
    - “Trace Related Events” — jumps to TimelinePage filtered by structure
    - “Add a Contradiction” (admin only)
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. No Linked Struggles**
    
    **Message:**
    
    > “No active or historical struggles have been linked to this structure.
    > 
    > 
    > Either this structure has remained stable — or resistance has yet to be tracked.”
    > 
    
    **Visual Cue:**
    
    - Subtle ghosting of `StruggleListMini` component
    - Icon suggestion: Undisturbed fortress or anchored monument
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Structure Has No Event History**
    
    **Message:**
    
    > “No key historical events currently linked to this structure.
    > 
    > 
    > Timeline may not yet reflect its evolution.”
    > 
    
    **Suggestion:**
    
    - "Consider investigating landmark reforms, crises, or acts of repression related to this formation."
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. No Structures Match Filter**
    
    **Message:**
    
    > “No structures match your current filters.
    > 
    > 
    > Try expanding your scope.”
    > 
    
    **Filters Reset CTA:**
    
    - “Clear All Filters”
    
    ---
    
    These states help reinforce a **critical reading of silence** — not as absence of meaning, but as **potential terrain for deeper inquiry or system expansion**.
    
    ### **11. Performance Considerations**
    
    The StructuresPage must maintain **snappy responsiveness** even as the number of entries grows. Since each structure potentially links to dozens of contradictions, struggles, and events, **optimization is key**.
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Virtualized Rendering of Cards**
    
    - Only load structure cards that are currently in view.
    - Use [React Virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) or [React Window](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-window) to render large lists without lag.
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Modal Data Lazy-Loading**
    
    - The `StructureDetailModal` should only fetch linked contradictions, struggles, and events **on open** — not preloaded with every card.
    - Use async loaders for:
        - `ContradictionListMini`
        - `StruggleListMini`
        - `StructureTimelineMini`
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Filter Debouncing**
    
    - Apply a debounce delay (e.g. 250–500ms) on filter change to reduce unnecessary re-renders or repeated queries.
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Batched Data Fetching**
    
    - When user first lands, fetch:
        - Basic card metadata for all structures in the selected region or type
    - Only when a card is expanded does it trigger deeper fetches
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. Caching Strategies**
    
    - Cache last 5–10 opened `StructureDetailModal` payloads locally
    - Cache filter queries by key (e.g., `type:economic + region:south-india`)
    
    ---
    
    ### **F. Progressive Enhancement for TimelineMini**
    
    - Load TimelineMini last, after contradictions and struggles are rendered
    - Show placeholder animation while loading (e.g., skeleton dots)
    
    ---
    
    By treating performance as an extension of theoretical clarity, Zoomout ensures users can **navigate historical terrain fluidly — without lag, delay, or overload**.
    
    ### **12. Versioning & Iteration Plans**
    
    The StructuresPage will evolve alongside the maturity of Zoomout’s sheet network and frontend engine. Its core logic remains stable — but features will be layered progressively to increase analytical depth and fluidity.
    
    ---
    
    ### **v1.0 — Baseline Release**
    
    - Static list of structures categorized by type
    - Manual linking to contradictions and struggles via sheet data

    ### **v1.1 — Structural Intelligence Upgrade**
    
    - Adds `StructureTimelineMini`
    - Auto-detect contradiction density and show highlight markers
    - Tag structures with inferred status: `reproduced`, `contested`, `ruptured`
    
    ---
    
    ### **v1.2 — Dynamic Ecosystem Integration**
    
    - Integrate structure filtering into all other pages (Contradictions, Struggles, Timeline)
    - Enable filtering by structures on ReportingPage
    - Cross-page modal navigation (structure modal opens from contradiction, and vice versa)
    
    ---
    
    ### **v1.3 — Reproduction Tracking Engine (Advanced)**
    
    - Auto-classify structural events as reproduction, rupture, reform
    - Visualize reproduction intensity over time (heatbar or timeline markers)
    - Allow annotation/logging of structural change triggers
    
    ---
    
    ### **v2.0+ (Post Narrative Model)**
    
    - Narrative overlays: “Which myths keep this structure intact?”
    - Theory Object integration: Ideological functions of structure
    - Auto-link to Theory Instances mentioning the structure
    
    ---
    
    This staged roadmap allows for steady complexity layering — never outpacing the user’s ability to make sense of the system.
    
    ### **13. Test Criteria**
    
    Testing the StructuresPage ensures not only that it functions correctly, but that it **preserves epistemological clarity**: Are structures legible? Are contradictions traceable? Is historical motion evident?
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Structural Rendering Accuracy**
    
    - [ ]  All structure cards display correct metadata from `Structures Sheet`
    - [ ]  Structure type and region filters correctly narrow the card set

    - [ ]  Page loads < 1.5s with 50+ structures
    - [ ]  Modal opens in < 300ms under normal conditions
    - [ ]  Lazy-loading and caching behavior operates correctly
    
    ---
    
    By treating test criteria as a lens on **historical consistency and analytical precision**, Zoomout maintains the integrity of its core premise: **structures condition motion — and must be tracked with care.**
    
    ### **14. Mobile-First Design Considerations**
    
    The StructuresPage must remain usable and insightful on small screens, without sacrificing its depth. While large-scale matrix thinking is ideal on desktop, mobile users should still be able to **navigate, absorb, and link** structural information with minimal friction.
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Responsive Layout Shift**
    
    - Grid layout collapses into **vertically stacked sections** by structure type
        - Economic
        - Political
        - Social
        - Cultural
    - Each section expandable/collapsible for focus
    - Filters move into a top drawer or bottom sheet modal
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Mobile `StructureCard` Behavior**
    
    - Cards expand accordion-style to show summary metadata
    - Tap-to-expand triggers `StructureDetailModal` as a **full-screen overlay**
    - Back button closes modal cleanly and restores scroll position
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Touch-Friendly Component Adjustments**
    
    - Increase tap areas on filter chips, tags, and card headers
    - Contradiction and struggle chips stack vertically inside modals
    - Use swipeable tab views for Overview / Contradictions / Struggles / Timeline
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Lightweight Timeline Rendering**
    
    - `StructureTimelineMini` becomes a **vertical scroll timeline** on mobile
        - Event dots stack with date and title
        - Tap to expand event preview
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. Sticky Interaction Layer**
    
    - Keep structure type filters **pinned at top** on scroll
    - Modal has fixed bottom-close button for intuitive navigation

    ### **F. Performance & Battery Considerations**
    
    - Prioritize async loading and caching to prevent mobile stutters
    - Avoid unnecessary animation on lower-end devices
    
    ---
    
    Zoomout’s dialectical architecture must be accessible in every context. The mobile version doesn’t need to be a condensed copy — it must offer **focused entry points** into structural motion.
    
    ### **15. Integration Points**
    
    The StructuresPage is not a silo — it is a **backbone node** in Zoomout’s ecosystem. It integrates both upstream (from theoretical ontology) and downstream (into contradiction-tracking and struggle-mapping).
    
    ---
    
    ### **A. Contradictions Page**
    
    - “Structural Basis” section for every contradiction pulls its data from the Structures Sheet
    - Clicking the structure link in that section opens the `StructureDetailModal` inline or in a new tab
    - Contradictions can be filtered by originating structure (planned for v1.2)
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Struggles Page**
    
    - Each struggle is tagged with `structure_id` of the formation it contests
    - Clicking on a structure from a struggle opens its full modal
    - Enables pattern detection: Which structures face the most sustained contestation?
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. Timeline Page**
    
    - Structural tags on events enable a user to build an **event chain** for a structure
    - Timeline filtering (future feature) by `structure_id` reveals historical motion of reproduction or rupture
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. WikiPage (Entities)**
    
    - Entity profiles display which structures they **reproduce, contest, or co-opt**
    - Can infer alignment patterns across caste-class-institutional lines
    - Enables deeper strategic mapping of institutional roles in historical structures
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. ReportingPage**
    
    - Structural filters for timeline-based reporting
    - Enables generation of summaries like:
        - “Events linked to political structures over the past year”
        - “Contradictions rooted in cultural structures with explosive phase in last 6 months”
    
    ---
    
    These integration points ensure the StructuresPage remains a **dynamic analytical engine**, not just a theoretical reference shelf.
    
    ### **16. Future Integrations**
    
    As Zoomout enters deeper phases of automation, narrative analysis, and real-time ingestion, the StructuresPage will evolve into a **multi-layered intelligence module** — capable of visualizing how formations persist, fracture, or mutate under historical pressure.

    ### **A. Structural Reproduction Cycle Mapping**
    
    - Visualize how a structure **reproduces itself** across time:
        - e.g., “Caste as Social Structure” → reinforced by **education**, **marriage**, **land ownership**, **religion**
    - Animated cycle view: user sees institutional and ideological mechanisms of continuity
    - Inspired by Marxist reproduction theory + ideological state apparatus theory (Althusser)
    
    ---
    
    ### **B. Narrative Overlay Integration (post-Ontology Update)**
    
    - Highlight how structures are **mythologized or depoliticized** in dominant narratives
    - e.g., “Caste is a social evil, but not a systemic structure” — a depoliticizing narrative
    - Theory Object and Theory Instance references will allow:
        - Quotes from media, manifestos, speeches
        - Mapping ideology to reproduction
    
    ---
    
    ### **C. AI-Assisted Structural Recognition (Phase 4+)**
    
    - Automatic detection of structures embedded in new event data
        - e.g., protest → state crackdown → tags “reproduction of police-state apparatus”
    - Structure suggestions from backend assistant (“This event may reinforce XYZ structure”)
    - Future link: **Event ingestion → real-time structural updates**
    
    ---
    
    ### **D. Structural Vulnerability Heatmaps (Phase 5)**
    
    - Map which structures are showing signs of rupture or instability
    - Based on metrics like:
        - Number of active struggles
        - Contradiction intensity shifts
        - Narrative fracture rate (when implemented)
    
    ---
    
    ### **E. Builder Logging Integration**
    
    - Internal logs (Living Changelog, Framework for Logging) may be optionally tagged to structures
    - Enables self-awareness: Which structures inside the project itself are being reinforced or ruptured?
    
    ---
    
    **Zoomout’s long-term structural goal is to make power visible, formation legible, and rupture traceable.**
    
    StructuresPage will eventually serve as the epistemic terrain for analyzing **the grammar of historical reproduction.**
