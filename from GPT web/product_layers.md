## Zoomout Product Layering & System Architecture

Zoomout is not a single tool, app, or interface. It is a **living contradiction engine**, structured across four interdependent layers. Each layer encodes materialist logic at a different abstraction level, and together they form a dialectically recursive machine.

---

## Layer 1: Ontology Core (What Zoomout *Is*) üß±

### Definition
Zoomout‚Äôs foundational layer ‚Äî its materialist ontology. This is where categories, schemas, and contradictions are defined, validated, and linked. It determines what Zoomout can *know*.

### Key Components
- **Core Elements**: Structures, Contradictions, Struggles, Events, Issues, Entities
- **Structural Features**: Timeline logic, phase modeling, relational maps
- **Classification Systems**: Typing, tagging, hierarchical nesting
- **Data Validation**: Source confidence, verification, stance metadata
- **Temporal Dynamics**: Escalation paths, suppression cycles, state response modeling

### Emergent Products
- **Contradiction Threading Engine**: Tracks contradiction across time and phases
- **Timeline Grid**: Chronological navigation by dialectical motion
- **Entity Map**: Visual map of actors and their structural linkages
- **Curriculum Mode**: Recursive learning tool that links contradiction, theory, and history

These are the epistemic tools of Zoomout ‚Äî rooted in contradiction and built for recursive perception.

## Layer 2: Functional Interface (What Zoomout *Does*) ‚öôÔ∏è

### Definition
Zoomout‚Äôs internal service layer: functional modules that activate ontological categories into analysis engines, learning paths, and simulation tools.

### Key Service Layers
- **Polygraph Engine**: Contradiction validator, ideological truth-tester
- **Class Struggle Simulator** *(planned)*: Simulates rupture potential based on structures and timelines
- **Dialectical Inference Engine** *(planned)*: Predicts missing contradictions using rule-based or ML logic
- **Curriculum Generator**: Builds personal dialectical learning arcs
- **Epistemic Confidence Layer**: Ranks input based on credibility, source, and stance

### Relationship to Ontology Core
Each module wraps 1‚Äì2 conceptual categories and operationalizes them.
Examples:
- Threading = Contradictions + Events
- Simulator = Struggles + Structures + Timelines
- Curriculum = Events + Theory + Phases

This layer **animates** the core.

## Layer 3: Narrative Shell (How Zoomout *Appears*) üé≠

### Definition
Zoomout adapts to different publics using **tactical framing** ‚Äî bundling service layers into coherent, purpose-built personas. These are not superficial brands; they are narrative strategies.

### Tactical Frames (Examples)

| Frame                       | Audience             | Bundle                                      |
|-----------------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Dialectical Engine          | Theory/Philosophy    | Curriculum Mode + Threading Engine          |
| Polygraph Engine            | Journalists/Analysts | Contradiction Tracker + Confidence Layer    |
| Class Struggle Engine       | Movements/Organizers | Timeline Grid + Escalation Modeling         |
| Zoomout as Host             | Digital Humanities   | Federated multi-user contradiction datasets |
| Materialism-as-a-Service    | Tech/Infra           | Cloud access to timelines + contradictions  |
| DA Interface (Mythic Layer) | Internal             | Polygraph + Threading + Curriculum          |
| Personal Curriculum         | Students             | Learning loop from contradiction datasets   |

This is how Zoomout **interfaces with sectors** without compromising its ontology.

## Layer 4: External Distribution (How Zoomout *Spreads*) üåê

### Definition
Tools that scale Zoomout‚Äôs ontology outward ‚Äî to users, publics, and other platforms.

### Products
- **Zoomout as Host**: User-run dialectical dataset spaces (federated + versioned)
- **NewsAgg**: Public contradiction aggregator for real-time conflict tracking
- **Polygraph Cards**: Bite-sized contradiction summaries for public UX, mobile, curriculum use

These tools are downstream products that preserve rigor while enabling reach.

Zoomout‚Äôs layering is not just architectural ‚Äî it‚Äôs epistemic.
It ensures consistency from **depth to surface**, from **ontology to UI**, from **theory to deployment**.

This is how Zoomout becomes a **curriculum**, a **host**, a **machine**, and a **weapon**.
